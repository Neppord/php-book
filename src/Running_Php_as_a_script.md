# Running Php as a script

Start by creating a php file named `helloworld.php` with the content below
```php
<?php
echo "Hello world";
```
and then from a commandline run the script like so
```
php helloworld.php
```
and you should see an output like this
```
Hello world
```
If this doesn't work for you, then you need to find help elsewhere before continuing. Try to find help in the documentation from the way you have installed php.
