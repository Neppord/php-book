# Introduction

## Why this book?
There seams to be a lot of content out there on how to get going with Php, which is great. But I could not find anything that was easily available that thought you Php from the ground up without any prerequisites. This book is my try to compliment the resources that are already out there with bite sized explanations and accompanied by a large assortment of exercises.

## How to read this book?

This book is meant to be a companion book to other material. The chapters should be easy enough to go through and select the particular concept you need to dig deeper into. You should also be able to start from the start and just go through it, but if you find a subject to easy for you then feel free to skip ahead to the next chapter.
